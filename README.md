### Acknowledgement
「无可奉告」is inseparable from the contribution of every member. 

The predecessor of this project was the software engineering course project of group members: [Tairan He](https://github.com/TairanHe), [Yiyuan Dong](https://github.com/Yiyuan-Dong), [Zimeng Huang](https://github.com/lllukehuang), [Ren Zhou](https://github.com/RenZhou0327), [ZhenQi Liu](https://github.com/LIF18) and [JiaXi Hu](https://github.com/jiaxihu0921).

In 2020 FALL Semester, we hope that this project is not just a course project, but a real distribution APP. So we __restarted the project__. [Tairan He](https://github.com/TairanHe) rewrote and completed the backend code in Python and improved Android frontend (special thanks to [Yi Gu](https://github.com/wu-qing-157) for the guidance on Android). [Zimeng Huang](https://github.com/lllukehuang) completed and optimized the database and [Yiyuan Dong](https://github.com/Yiyuan-Dong) improved server performance.

The most sincere gratitude to [Haichen Dong](https://github.com/oscardhc) who implemented [iOS无可奉告](https://github.com/oscardhc/Forum) and contributed a lot to backend optimization and web service. This project can not be accomplished without the contribution of [Haichen Dong](https://github.com/oscardhc).

Also, thank you to all those who participated in the internal testing process, your helpful suggestions make the project better.
